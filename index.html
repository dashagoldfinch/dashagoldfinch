    <h1><b>Jean-Luc Godard. Some footage.
        I really enjoy watching his flims.</b></h1>
    <h6>FAVOURITE FILMS, 2020</h6>
    <img src="assets/g1.jpg" alt="scene from the film">
    <p>His work makes use of frequent
        homages and references to film history,
        and often expressed his political views;
        he was an avid reader of existential
        and Marxist philosophy</p>

    <p>Godard's most celebrated period
        as a director spans roughly from his first feature,
        Breathless (1960), through to Week End (1967).
        His work during this period focused on relatively
        conventional films that often refer to different aspects
        of film history. Although Godard's work during this time
        is considered groundbreaking in its own right, the period
        stands in contrast to that which immediately followed it,
        during which Godard ideologically denounced much of cinema's history
        as "bourgeois" and therefore without merit.</p>
